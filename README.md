## Summary
I created a test website which shows a list of products of a shop "Outfitx". 
At this date i'm writing this (13/12/2021), it contains a landing page showing all products available and a second page which can be accessed throught the menu bar which is an about page showing info of the shop itself.
I used angular services to display products which are stored in an array called products[].
this website doesnt contain a database yet, but i master the services thing , i will link it to one.
